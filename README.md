# Video Editor AI

## Overview
Video Editor AI is an intelligent video editing tool that leverages artificial intelligence to automate and enhance video editing tasks. It provides features such as automatic scene detection, background removal, smart trimming, and AI-powered effects to streamline the video editing process.

## Features
- **Automatic Scene Detection**: Detects and segments different scenes in a video.
- **Smart Trimming**: Removes unnecessary parts of a video based on AI analysis.
- **Background Removal**: Removes or replaces backgrounds using AI-driven segmentation.
- **Audio Enhancement**: Improves audio quality by reducing noise and normalizing levels.
- **Text and Subtitles Generation**: Generates subtitles automatically using speech recognition.
- **AI Effects and Filters**: Applies AI-enhanced filters and effects to videos.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Pip
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)
- FFmpeg (for video processing)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/video-editor-ai.git
   cd video-editor-ai
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the AI video editor:
   ```sh
